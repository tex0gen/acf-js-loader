# ACF External Colour Picker Field
This gets a list of colours and their values from a file in the theme directory.
Each field that has a "background colour" field can have set colour values that match the theme design.
The point of adding these colours in a single place within the theme directory is so that we don't need to update every background colour field that exists within the bootstrap-4-theme.

This has not been developed for ACF v4, despite it being prepared.
